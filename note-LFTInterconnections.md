# Fleeting Note 
	1st - 3rd review: orginal -> underline -> highlight

An important property of LFTs is that typical algebraic operations preserve the LFT structure. These include inverses as well as serial, parallel, and feedback connections. Thus interconnections of LFTs can also be represented as a LFT. It is also important to note that combining LFTs, each with their own uncertainty, leads to an LFT with a "structured" uncertainty. Details are provided in the following subsections. General models constructed via such LFT interconnections are rational functions of the uncertainty (with linear or polynomial dependence on the uncertainty as special cases). This is quite general but cannot be used to specify non-rational dependence on uncertainties, e.g. $\sqrt{a}$ cannot be represented as an LFT on $a$.
