# Fleeting Note 
	1st - 3rd review: orginal -> underline -> highlight

The previous section covered the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimal control problem. The objective in LQR design is to regulate the state back to zero from an initial condition. The problem is formulated using a time-domain quadratic cost that involves a trade-oﬀ between regulation performance and control usage. The optimal solution can be expressed as a constant-gain state-feedback controller. This section considers an alternative optimal control problem focusing on referencing tracking and output feedback.
