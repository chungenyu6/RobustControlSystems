# Fleeting Note 
	1st - 3rd review: orginal -> underline -> highlight

Several robust stability results have been presented thus far that move beyond classical, SISO gain and phase margins. A general framework will be developed next to unify these various results. Section 1 introduces several basic building blocks or ‚Äúatoms‚Äù for modeling uncertain dynamic systems. These atoms model uncertainty for real parameters, complex parameters, and dynamic LTI systems. Sections 2 and 3 then introduce linear fractional transformations (LFTs). LFTs can be used to build uncertain models from the atoms possibly with multiple sources of uncertainty. The procedure is separate the known parts of the model from the unknown (uncertain) parts in a feedback-like connection. The range of possible values for the unknown parts is assumed to be bounded. The analysis framework, introduced later, uses these uncertain models to assess both robust stability and robust performance.
